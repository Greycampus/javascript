/*In physics, contact between objects during a collision leads to loss of force as no medium is perfect.
likely we are having n medium in a plane each of equal length followed by qouitient of reduction, In can be well
explained using the following example
person throws a ball on plane from certain height h of n medium your job is to find distance traveled in plane
and the medium is repetted in cyclic order and height is only considered in integers
input:
3(number of medium)
4(length of each)
5(height from which ball is thrown)
2(distance travelled for each step)
0.1
0.3
0.5
output:
first  step 5*0.9= 4 dist = 2
second step 4*0.9= 3 dist = 4
third  step 3*0.7= 2 dist = 6
fouth  step 2*0.7= 1 dist = 8
fifth  step 1*0.5= 0 dist = 10
so,the result is 10(ten) steps

Input
enter total number of mediums:3
enter length of medium:4
enter height from which ball is thrown:8
enter distance travelled in each step:5
enter value for 3 mediums:0.2
0.3
0.5
Output
distance travelled by the ball is 25
