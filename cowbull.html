['1','2','3'].findIndex(function de(a){return a==gg[j];});
Python program to make a game similar to cows and bulls
Two players can play the game
firstly a player enters a 4 digit secret number in range of 1-6.
Second player have to guess the number given by first player in 3 guesses
Suppose if first player entered 1234 as secret number
second player will be given three chances for guessing
1st guess : 1345 => should print +--  as (+)1 is at exact position and also present in secret number
    (-)3,4 are in number but in different position  (' ')5 not in number
2nd guess : 1234 => should print ++++ and you won and stops 3rd guess as player won

Input
enter secret number for game:2345
player have three guesses for a 4digit number.(number range 1-6)

Output
1234
 --- have another try
1245
 -++ have another try
2345
++++ you won
well played
